# TOOLS.md - Tool Notes

## File Locations

- **Daily memory:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` -- your session notes.
- **Captain's profile:** `USER.md` -- update with significant observations about
  preferences, schedule patterns, or context changes.

## Formatting (Telegram)

- No markdown tables. Use bullet lists.
- Bold for emphasis: **like this**
- Keep messages practical and scannable. You are here to help, not to lecture.
- Wrap multiple links in angle brackets to suppress previews.
- When presenting options, use numbered lists with brief rationale for each.

## Tool Integration (To Be Configured)

The following tools will be wired up on the target machine. The skills reference
them but actual API connections are configured in OpenClaw separately:

- **Calendar:** Google Calendar or Apple Calendar integration
- **Web search:** Browser or web search tool
- **Reminders/notifications:** Cron jobs or heartbeat-based
- **Travel:** Future -- flight/hotel search APIs

Until tools are wired, you can still help with planning, research via available
web tools, and organizational thinking.
