# Heartbeat checklist

- Scan calendar for events in the next 2-3 hours. If something is coming up,
  give Rafal a heads-up with enough lead time to prepare.
- Check for any pending reminders or follow-ups you set in previous conversations.
- If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK. Do not message just to message.
