# Nutrition Analysis -- Cronometer Data Review

## Daily Targets

- **Calories:** 2,200 kcal/day (flat, no cycling)
- **Protein:** 137g (25%) -- 1.9g/kg
- **Carbs:** 303g (55%) -- 4.1g/kg
- **Fat:** 49g (20%) -- 0.7g/kg
- **Sodium:** <2,500mg/day
- **Water:** 2,000ml minimum (8 x 250ml glasses)

## Macro Rationale

**Protein at 1.9g/kg:** Evidence supports 1.6-2.2g/kg for 40+ trainees doing
resistance training. 1.9g/kg is a workable compromise -- the patient feels
bloated above ~140g/day. Do not push higher unless he requests it. Protein
sources: whey, eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, legumes, tofu.

**Carbs at 55%:** High by bodybuilding standards but correct for this program.
Carbs fuel HIT training intensity (glycolytic demand is high at failure). Also
support tendon healing -- tendons are metabolically active tissue that benefits
from glucose availability.

**Fat at 20%:** Enough for hormonal function at age 40. Below 15% risks
testosterone suppression in middle-aged males. Not a fear, not a focus -- just
keep it in range.

**Calories at 2,200:** Slight deficit from estimated TDEE (~2,400-2,500) for
recomposition. Enough to fuel training, small enough to drive gradual fat loss.
If lifts stall persistently and recovery suffers, consider raising to 2,300-2,400
temporarily.

## Sodium Strategy

**Target: <2,500mg/day**

Why it matters:
- High sodium causes water retention (0.5-2kg overnight)
- Water retention inflates BIA body fat readings (1-3%)
- This creates false "weight gain" that frustrates the patient and masks real
  progress
- Sustained high sodium may contribute to blood pressure elevation

**Known high-sodium culprits in this patient's diet:**
- Processed vegan meats (sausages, deli slices) -- 400-800mg per serving
- Soy sauce (regular) -- 900mg per tablespoon
- French fries -- sodium + fat double hit
- Pumpernickel bread -- moderate sodium, adds up with multiple slices
- Kimchi -- high sodium density, watch portion sizes

**Reduction tactics:**
- Half-portion processed vegan meats
- Low-sodium soy sauce (tamari)
- No french fries
- Pinch of salt at the plate, not in cooking (perceived salt > actual sodium)
- Pumpernickel with low-sodium toppings (bean paste, hummus) instead of vegan ham
- Read labels always -- many vegetarian convenience foods are sodium-heavy

## Hydration

**Target: 8 x 250ml glasses throughout the day (2L minimum)**

- Sip throughout the day, do not chug large amounts at once
- Coffee counts as ~200ml effective hydration per 250ml cup
- Pinch of salt in water bottle for electrolyte-aided retention
- Drink with meals for better absorption
- The patient is chronically under-hydrated
- Frequent urination when increasing water intake is temporary adaptation (2-3
  weeks). Magnesium deficiency may contribute to bladder irritability.
- Once magnesium supplementation is established, reassess hydration tolerance

## Reviewing a Cronometer Export

When analyzing a nutrition data file, check in this order:

### 1. Calorie Check
- Is daily average near 2,200 kcal?
- Any days significantly over (>2,500) or under (<1,800)?
- Under-eating is as concerning as over-eating for recomp

### 2. Macro Distribution
- Protein near 137g? (acceptable range: 120-150g)
- Carbs near 303g? (acceptable range: 270-340g)
- Fat near 49g? (acceptable range: 40-60g)
- If protein is low, check if it was a low-effort eating day or systematic

### 3. Sodium
- Any days above 2,500mg? What caused it?
- Look for patterns: specific foods, eating out, processed items
- Correlate with next-day weight/BF% data if available

### 4. Micronutrients of Interest
- **Magnesium:** Still likely low even with supplementation. Track food sources.
- **Iron:** Vegetarians can be low. Pair iron-rich foods with vitamin C.
- **B12:** Supplementation or fortified foods needed on vegetarian diet. Check if
  adequate.
- **Calcium:** Should be sufficient with dairy, but verify.
- **Zinc:** Can be low on vegetarian diets. Legumes and seeds help.
- **Omega-3:** No fish = no EPA/DHA. Walnuts, flax, chia provide ALA (poor
  conversion). Consider flagging if consistently absent.

### 5. Fiber
- Vegetarian diets are usually adequate but verify
- Target: 25-35g/day
- Too much fiber with inadequate water = GI discomfort

### 6. Data Quality
- Watch for suspicious entries (the 30oz kimchi incident)
- Cross-reference Cronometer database values against packaging when possible
- Common Cronometer issues: wrong serving size selected, database entry errors,
  generic vs branded items having different values

## Patterns to Flag

- **3+ consecutive high-sodium days:** Likely to cause visible water retention and
  BIA distortion. Explain the mechanism, suggest specific swaps.
- **Protein consistently under 120g:** May impair muscle protein synthesis on a
  recomp. Gently suggest adding a protein source.
- **Calories consistently under 1,900:** Too aggressive a deficit. Raises cortisol,
  impairs recovery, risks muscle loss. Flag this.
- **Fat consistently under 35g:** Hormonal risk at age 40. Flag this.
- **Hydration not logged:** Remind that water matters. If Cronometer does not track
  water, ask about compliance conversationally.

## Communicating Results

- Lead with the positive ("Your protein has been consistently on target this week")
- Then address concerns with specifics ("Tuesday and Thursday both hit 3,200mg
  sodium -- both days had processed vegan sausage at lunch")
- Offer concrete alternatives, not just warnings
- Do not catastrophize single bad days. The weekly average matters more.
- If BIA weight jumped after a high-sodium day, explain the water mechanism before
  the patient spirals
