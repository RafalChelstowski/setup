## Ingredients
- 400g firm tofu, pressed and cubed
- 2 tbsp cornstarch
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- pinch of black pepper
- 300g rice (dry weight, cook in rice cooker)
- 400g mixed vegetables (broccoli, bell pepper, snap peas, carrot)
- 2 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce (tamari)
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp fresh ginger, grated
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- optional: sriracha or chili flakes to taste

## Method
1. Press tofu for 10 min (wrap in towel, place heavy object on top). Cut into
   2cm cubes.
2. Start rice in rice cooker.
3. Toss tofu cubes in cornstarch, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder,
   and black pepper.
4. Air fry at 200C for 12-15 min, shaking basket halfway. Tofu should be golden
   and crispy.
5. While tofu cooks, stir-fry vegetables in a pan with sesame oil over high heat,
   3-4 min. Add garlic and ginger, cook 30 seconds.
6. Add low-sodium soy sauce and rice vinegar to vegetables, toss.
7. Serve crispy tofu over rice with vegetables.

## Notes
- Pressing tofu well is the key to crispy results. The drier, the crispier.
- Double the tofu batch and store extras in fridge for 2-3 days -- reheat in air
  fryer for 3-4 min.
- Swap vegetables based on what you have. Edamame adds extra protein.
- The low-sodium soy sauce keeps this under 400mg sodium per serving. Regular soy
  sauce would triple it.
