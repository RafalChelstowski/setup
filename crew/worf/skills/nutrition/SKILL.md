# Nutrition -- Mentzer-Aligned Recomposition Protocol

## Daily Targets

- **Calories:** 2,200 kcal/day (flat, no cycling)
- **Protein:** 137g (25%) -- 1.9g/kg
- **Carbs:** 303g (55%) -- 4.1g/kg
- **Fat:** 49g (20%) -- 0.7g/kg
- **Sodium:** <2,500mg/day

No calorie cycling. No refeed days. Consistent intake supports consistent
training intensity and simplifies adherence.

## Macro Rationale

**Protein at 1.9g/kg:** Modern evidence suggests 1.6-2.2g/kg is optimal for 40+
trainees. 1.9g/kg sits in the sweet spot. The trainee feels bloated at higher
intakes -- forcing 2.2g/kg would reduce compliance. Mentzer himself advocated
moderate protein. This is a workable compromise.

**Carbs at 55%:** High by bodybuilding standards, correct by Mentzer standards.
Carbs fuel training intensity. A depleted trainee cannot train to failure
effectively. Carbs also support achilles tendon healing (tendons are metabolically
active tissue).

**Fat at 20%:** Enough for hormonal function at age 40. Mentzer suggested 15%,
but modern endocrinology favors slightly higher for testosterone maintenance in
middle-aged males. Not a fear, not a focus.

## Diet Context

- **Vegetarian:** Includes eggs, dairy, whey protein. No meat, no fish.
- **Protein sources:** Whey, eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, legumes, tofu
- **Feels bloated with excessive protein:** Respect this. Do not push above 140g
  unless the trainee requests it.

## Sodium Strategy

Target: <2,500mg/day. High sodium causes water retention that:
- Masks fat loss progress on the scale
- Inflates BIA body fat readings
- Causes frustration that undermines adherence

**Specific tactics:**
- Half-portion processed vegan meats (high sodium density)
- Low-sodium soy sauce instead of regular
- No french fries (sodium + fat bomb)
- Pinch of salt at the plate, not in cooking (perceived salt > actual sodium)
- Pumpernickel with low-sodium toppings (bean paste, hummus) instead of
  high-sodium vegan ham
- Read labels. Many vegetarian convenience foods are sodium-heavy.

## Hydration Protocol

- **Target:** 8 glasses of 250ml water throughout the day (2L minimum)
- **Method:** Sip throughout the day, do not chug
- **Coffee counts:** ~200ml effective hydration per 250ml cup
- **Electrolytes:** Pinch of salt in water bottle for retention
- **With meals:** Drink water with meals for better absorption
- **The trainee is chronically under-hydrated.** Frequent urination when
  increasing water intake is a temporary adaptation (2-3 weeks). Magnesium
  deficiency may contribute to bladder irritability.

## Supplements

| Supplement | Dose | Timing | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Creatine monohydrate | 5g/day | Any time, daily | Proven. No loading needed. Every day including rest days. |
| Vitamin D | 2,000-3,000 IU/day | With a meal containing fat | Essential for indoor trainees. Could increase to 3,000 IU. |
| Magnesium glycinate | 300-400mg | Before bed | Recovery mineral. Helps sleep quality. The trainee averages 191mg vs 420mg RDA -- significant deficit. |

No other supplements recommended. The supplement industry sells hope. These three
are the ones with actual evidence behind them.

## BIA Scale Interpretation

**Critical rule: React to trends, not data points.**

- BIA readings fluctuate 1-3% based on hydration, sodium, time of day, and
  whether the trainee recently ate
- A single-day jump from 21.7% to 22.4% is almost certainly water retention,
  not fat gain
- The meaningful signal is the 4-week trend
- Weigh-in conditions: same time of day, after waking, after bathroom, before
  eating
- If the trainee panics about a daily fluctuation, explain the water retention
  mechanism. Do not validate the panic.

**Real progress markers (Jan-Feb 2026):** BF% trending from ~24% down to ~22%.
This is real. The daily noise is not.

**Secondary measurements:**
- Monthly waist measurement (more reliable than BIA for fat loss tracking)
- How clothes fit (qualitative but motivating)
- Strength progression (if lifts are going up on a deficit, recomp is working)

## Cronometer Awareness

The trainee uses Cronometer for food logging. Known issues:
- **Database entries may have errors.** Pumpernickel carbs were listed as
  43.4g/100g in Cronometer vs 32.5g/100g on the actual package.
- **Sodium was correct** after salt-to-sodium conversion (salt x 0.4 = sodium)
- **Portion logging errors happen.** A 30oz kimchi entry was actually ~50g.
  Corrected sodium for that day dropped from 6,258mg to ~2,270mg.
- **Advise the trainee to verify entries** against packaging, especially for
  frequently-eaten items.

## Expected Recomposition Results

- **Monthly fat loss:** ~1kg
- **Target:** 22% -> 15-17% BF
- **Timeline:** Multi-month process (4-6 months for initial target range)
- **Weight:** Should stay around 73kg (fat replaced by muscle)
- **If weight drops below 71kg:** calories may be too low, reassess
- **If weight rises above 75kg without obvious sodium/water cause:** reassess
