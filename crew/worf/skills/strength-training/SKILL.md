# Strength Training -- Mentzer High Intensity Training

## Core Principles

- **One working set to failure per exercise.** Some compounds get 2 sets (bench,
  squat, RDL) for safety margin at 1 RIR. Never 3+.
- **Progressive overload is the only law.** More weight or more reps, session to
  session. If progress stalls, reduce frequency before adding volume.
- **Recovery is sacred.** Muscles grow during rest. The 4-day rotation with 1-2
  rest days between sessions is the minimum. Take more if needed.
- **Full ROM only.** Partial reps confirm failure but are not logged as reps.
- **Failure means impossible.** Not uncomfortable -- impossible. The set ends when
  another full rep cannot be completed.

## 4-Day Rotation

### Day A: Chest + Back

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Intensity | Starting Weight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bench Press (BB) | 2 working | 6-8 | 1 RIR | 61kg |
| DB Row | 1-2 working | 6-8 | Failure | 27.5kg/hand |
| Incline Close-Grip Bench (BB) | 1 working | 8-10 | Failure | 45-48kg |
| Bent Over Row (BB) | 1 working | 8-10 | Failure | 41kg |

### Day B: Legs (Quad Focus)

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Intensity | Starting Weight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Squat (BB) | 2 working | 10-12 | 1 RIR | 43.5kg |
| Bulgarian Split Squat (DB) | 1 working | 12-15/leg | Failure | 7.5kg/hand |
| Standing Calf Raise (BB) | 2 working | 15-20 | Failure | 48.5kg |

### Day C: Arms + Delts

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Intensity | Starting Weight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Shoulder Press (DB) | 2 working | 8-10 | Failure | 12.5kg/hand |
| EZ Bar Curl | 2 working | 8-10 | Failure + slow neg | 23.5kg |
| Dips (bench-supported) | 1 working | To failure | Failure | Bodyweight |
| Lateral Raise (DB) | 1 working | To failure | Failure | 5kg/hand |

### Day D: Legs (Posterior + Glutes)

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Intensity | Starting Weight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Romanian Deadlift (BB) | 2 working | 8-10 | 1 RIR | 66kg |
| BB Hip Thrust | 2 working | 10-12 | Failure | 40-45kg |
| Good Morning (BB) | 1 working | 10-12 | Failure (form-limited) | 25kg |
| Standing Calf Raise (BB) | 2 working | 15-20 | Failure | 48.5kg |

## Warmup Protocol

- First compound of the day: 2-3 warmup sets with progressive weight
- Second compound (same muscle group): 0-1 warmup set
- Isolation/bodyweight: no warmup needed
- Warmup reps decrease as weight increases (12 -> 8 -> 3-4)
- Rest between warmups: 30-60 seconds
- Rest before first working set: 90-120 seconds
- Warmups should never feel tiring

## Rest Periods

- Between working sets: 2-3 minutes
- Between warmup sets: 30-60 seconds
- Between exercises: 2-3 minutes (or as needed)

## Progression Rules

1. **Hit top of rep range with good form?** Add 2.5kg (barbell) or next DB up
2. **Stalled 2 consecutive sessions?** Add an extra rest day before that workout
3. **Stalled 3 consecutive sessions?** Take 1 full week off (deload), resume same
   weights. Expect to come back stronger.

## Safety Rules

- **Barbell compounds (bench, squat, RDL):** 1 RIR, never absolute failure,
  unless safety bars are confirmed and tested with bail-out practice
- **Dumbbell exercises:** Failure is safe -- drop on puzzle mats
- **EZ bar, bodyweight, hip thrust:** Failure is safe
- **Safety bars must be set before every barbell session:**
  - Bench: just below chest when arched
  - Squat: just above bottom of range
- **Good morning failure = form failure.** Stop when back position degrades. Do
  not push to spinal failure.

## Form Cues

**Bench Press:**
- Grip width: 55-60cm
- Elbows: 60-75 degrees (arrow shape, not T-shape)
- Shoulder blades: retracted and depressed
- Bar path: to mid/lower chest
- Squat rack is 66cm wide -- confirmed to work with safety bars

**Incline DB Press (when used):**
- Neutral grip (palms facing each other) for shoulder safety
- This is a known bottleneck: cannot bridge 20kg to 25kg/hand. Needs 22.5kg
  DBs or micro-plates.

**Dips:**
- Currently bench-supported (rack dip handles at 66cm are slightly wide)
- Progression: feet on floor -> feet elevated -> weight plate on lap
- When 15+ reps are reached, add external load

**DB Row:**
- Weights logged as combined (both hands). 50kg = 25kg per hand.
- Back is significantly stronger than expected -- push weight aggressively

## Pre-Exhaustion (Week 8+)

Deferred technique for when bench press plateaus. Protocol:
- Squeeze press (DBs together, press up) to pre-fatigue chest
- Immediately superset into bench press
- The pre-fatigued chest fails before triceps, ensuring chest is the limiter
- Do NOT introduce before honest progressive overload is exhausted

## Session Review Checklist

When reviewing a workout log, check:
1. **Progressive overload:** Did weight or reps increase vs last session?
2. **Rep range compliance:** Are working sets within target ranges?
3. **Failure confirmation:** Did the trainee actually reach failure/1 RIR?
4. **Form notes:** Any mentions of pain, discomfort, or breakdown?
5. **Recovery signals:** How did the trainee feel going in? Soreness from prior?
6. **Session duration:** Should be ~25-35 minutes of working time
7. **Warmup compliance:** Were warmup sets performed?

Flag concerns directly. Praise genuine progress. Do not inflate.
