# Running -- Norwegian Polarized Model

## Status

Running is currently **suspended** due to achilles tendon problems. Reintroduction
target: **month 4-5** of the training program (approximately June-July 2026).
Until then, the BikeErg is the only cardio modality.

Do not program running sessions before the medical officer clears the trainee.

## Philosophy

The same principle that governs strength training applies to running: minimum
junk volume, maximum intensity when intensity is called for, maximum recovery
between hard efforts.

The Norwegian/polarized model maps directly to Mentzer's HIT:
- **Mentzer:** 1 hard set to failure, then recover fully
- **Polarized:** Hard days hard, easy days easy, nothing in between

The trainee's previous approach (80-90km/week at moderate effort) was the running
equivalent of 20 sets of bench press -- volume for volume's sake. That era is over.

## Polarized Training Model

- **80% easy:** Conversational pace, nose-breathing, HR Zone 1-2
- **20% hard:** Threshold or VO2max intervals, HR Zone 4-5
- **0% moderate:** No "comfortably hard" junk miles. This is the critical rule.
  Moderate effort is the most seductive and most destructive training zone.

## When Running Returns

### Weekly Structure (target)
- **2 runs/week maximum**
  - 1 easy trail run (60-90 min, conversational)
  - 1 hard session (threshold intervals or hill repeats)
- **BikeErg:** 1-2 sessions/week, steady state HR 120-140
- **Strength training:** Continues as primary -- reduce to 3 sessions/week if
  needed to accommodate running recovery

### Trail Running Specifics
- **Location:** Taunus mountains (near Frankfurt)
- **Equipment:** Trail running poles (reduce achilles load on descents)
- **Terrain:** Trails, not roads. Softer surface, varied loading angles, reduced
  repetitive strain on the achilles
- **No street running.** The achilles demands terrain variety.

### Reintroduction Protocol
1. **Week 1-2:** Walk/run intervals on flat trails (5 min run / 2 min walk x 4-6)
2. **Week 3-4:** Continuous easy running, 20-30 min, flat to gentle terrain
3. **Week 5-6:** Extend to 40-50 min easy, introduce gentle hills
4. **Week 7-8:** Add one harder session (tempo or hill repeats, short)
5. **Ongoing:** Build volume slowly. Max 10% increase per week.

If achilles pain returns at any stage, stop and consult the medical officer.

## BikeErg (Current Cardio)

- **When:** Non-leg off days only. NOT before or after Day B or Day D.
- **Duration:** 20-30 minutes
- **Intensity:** Steady state, HR 120-140 (Zone 2)
- **Purpose:** Maintain aerobic base with zero achilles impact
- **Can substitute** for a running session if running is available but conditions
  are poor (weather, fatigue, minor achilles irritation)

## Achilles Awareness

The trainee follows an Alfredson protocol (3x15 eccentric calf loading) managed
by the medical officer. This is done every training session.

As a coach, you should:
- **Know it exists** and that it adds ~5 min to each session
- **Not modify it** without medical officer input
- **Monitor for complaints** -- if the trainee reports increased achilles pain
  after training, flag it for medical review
- **Consider calf raise programming** in context -- the trainee is already doing
  significant calf loading via the Alfredson protocol, so calf raise working
  sets in the strength program should account for this total volume

## HR Zones (Reference)

For a 40-year-old male (estimated max HR ~180):
- **Zone 1 (Recovery):** <126 bpm
- **Zone 2 (Easy aerobic):** 126-144 bpm -- target for easy runs and BikeErg
- **Zone 3 (Moderate/Tempo):** 144-158 bpm -- AVOID this zone for steady work
- **Zone 4 (Threshold):** 158-167 bpm -- hard intervals
- **Zone 5 (VO2max):** 167-180 bpm -- short, sharp efforts

These are estimates. Actual zones should be validated with a field test when
running resumes.

## Off-Day Activities

- **Apple Fitness Yoga:** Any off day, 20 min. Encouraged.
- **Apple Fitness Core:** Any off day, 10-20 min. Avoid day before Day D
  (posterior legs) as it affects RDL/hip thrust bracing.
- **Walking/light mobility:** Always fine.
